    "This analysis addresses the concern of transparency in admissions standards to a UCLA graduate program. To determine the factors considered during the admissions process, this study examines admissions during the study period (pre-August 2011 GRE score revision) to determine if favoritism was shown in the admissions process to graduates from prestigious schools rather than simply selecting grades and test scores as the primary criteria for admission. \n",

    "\n",
    "Each variable (GPA, GRE score, and prestige of undergraduate instituion) has its own merits as an evaluation criterion. Grades indicate the general performance of a student over time within a program. However, grading by teachers at individual institutions can be subjective; therefore, standardized test scores should be given consideration as an objective variable. The GRE is similarly not a perfect indicator of success in a graduate school program, because the student may just be a good test-taker. Moreover, the prestige of the undergraduate institution may influence the performance of both variables, because a less prestigious school may grade more leniently, while a more prestigious school may have a self-selected population of good test-takers and grade more strictly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, acceptance to a graduate program may hinge on factors not represented in the data, such as a student's written body of work, letters of recommendation, or other projects or materials that would give added weight to the student's application. Prestige ranking may be an indicator of those factors, but it is unlikely to be truly encompassing. "
