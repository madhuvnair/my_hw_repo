    "The story of the Titanic was famous before it was made into a movie starring Kate and Leo. It is usually thought of as a story of hubris on the part of the engineers and of the captain. While the story of the collision is well documented, we can learn more about who was able to survive by examining the Titanic dataset and looking for patterns of the survivors. \n",
