    "This analysis addresses the concern of transparency in admissions standards to a UCLA graduate program. To determine the factors considered during the admissions process, this study examines admissions during the study period (pre-August 2011 GRE score revision) to determine if favoritism was shown in the admissions process to graduates from prestigious schools rather than simply selecting grades and test scores as the primary criteria for admission. \n",
